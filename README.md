# Smarteats

# Overview

With this project what I wanted to do was to implement a list of items that your pet can and cannot eat. It's a simple REACT web app that has a drop down list that shows what is good or not good to eat. 

I created a very basic web app that has a drop down list. To start it, you open up the file in your directory ( for example, if i have it stored in my PROJECTS folder i would first CD into the folder, CD projects, then i would CD into the actual file CD smarteats.) Afterwards i would run NPM install then NPM start to get the server running.

I have a pet named Izzie, she is one of the best things in my life. She however loves to eat, and sometimes there are foods that we want to share with her but aren't necessarily safe. So with the app, it allows us to know what is safe and what is not for her to eat. I wanted all pets to be able to have this luxury as well.

# Web Pages

With it being a REACT webapp, there is only one page. The page shows a drop down list of what are good foods and what are bad foods.

# Development Environment

To create this web app, i used REACT JS along with node. I used these inside of VS Code.
